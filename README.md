# Delft-bikefinder
A small react native application to find your bike at bike storage 2 at Delft Station. Scan the QR-code of your bikespot and it will automagicly safe the location.

TODO:
Get it now on (link)F-Droid and (link)Play Store

## Features
- Works completely offline, no accounts etc needed
- Designed to be simple and useful
- Always remembers last spot, even if you (accidentally) delete your history

## Work in progress
- English version
- Support for more bike storages (If any of them do have QR-codes? If so let me know!)
- Add to the App Store (Apple devices are already supported by the app. As a poor I cannot pay the high fee for the app store sadly. If someone can help me, that would be great!)

## Contributing
Contributions are always nice and are more than welcome. However there is one important thing to remember:
> KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)
So please don't add Redux, to name an example... :P
